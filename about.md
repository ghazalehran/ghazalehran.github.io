<h1 style="color: #FF6347; font-size: 2em; font-family: 'Cursive', sans-serif;">Hi, I’m Ghazaleh!</h1>
<p style="font-size: 1.2em; color: #555;">(pronounced: GHAH-zah-leh)</p>

<p>I’m an <strong>AI & Data Science Specialist</strong> with a passion for transforming physiological data into actionable insights that advance healthcare and biotechnology. My work exists at the intersection of <strong>biomedical science</strong> and <strong>computer science</strong>, where I focus on developing scalable AI systems that enhance patient care and health outcomes, performing statistical analysis on complex datasets, and harmonizing and integrating large-scale datasets to optimize performance and insights.</p>

<p>Since 2021, I’ve honed my expertise in EEG (electroencephalography), working with both software and hardware technologies. My primary focus has been on <strong>algorithm development</strong>, particularly in advancing neurodiagnostic applications. I thrive on tackling complex challenges and designing solutions that have a real-world impact on healthcare and wellness.</p>

<p>When I’m not working on AI solutions, I’m deeply engaged in the field of <strong>computational neuroscience</strong>. I am constantly exploring new avenues within the field, pushing the boundaries of AI and neuroscience to uncover insights that can revolutionize how we understand the brain and its functions.</p>

<p>Collaboration is at the heart of my approach. I am always eager to connect with like-minded professionals and explore opportunities that can challenge me, foster innovation, and promote growth. If you’re interested in collaborating or discussing ideas, I’d love to hear from you!</p>
