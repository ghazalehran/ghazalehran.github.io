Hi, I’m Ghazaleh (pronounced: GHAH-zah-leh), a Biosignal AI Specialist with a focus on analyzing physiological data and developing innovative AI solutions for healthcare and biotechnology. My work lies at the intersection of biomedical engineering and artificial intelligence, where I design scalable systems that enhance patient care and health outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>
Since 2021, I’ve specialized in EEG, working with both software and hardware devices. However, my primary emphasis has been on algorithm development to advance neurodiagnostic applications. Beyond my professional experience, I am deeply passionate about computational neuroscience. I constantly seek opportunities to expand my knowledge and apply it to cutting-edge challenges in AI and neuroscience.
