Hi, I’m Ghazaleh (pronounced: GHAH-zah-leh), a Biosignal AI Specialist with a focus on analyzing physiological data and developing innovative AI solutions for healthcare and biotechnology. My work lies at the intersection of biomedical engineering and artificial intelligence, where I design scalable systems that enhance patient care and health outcomes.

Since 2021, I’ve specialized in EEG, working with both software and hardware devices. However, my primary emphasis has been on algorithm development to advance neurodiagnostic applications. Beyond my professional experience, I am deeply passionate about computational neuroscience. I constantly seek opportunities to expand my knowledge and apply it to cutting-edge challenges in AI and neuroscience.
