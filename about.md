<h1 style="color: #FF6347; font-size: 4em; font-family: 'Cursive', sans-serif;">Hi, I’m Ghazaleh!</h1>
<p style="font-size: 1.2em; color: #555;">(pronounced: GHAH-zah-leh)</p>

<p>I’m a <strong>Biosignal AI Specialist</strong> with a passion for transforming physiological data into actionable insights that advance healthcare and biotechnology. My work lies at the exciting crossroads of <strong>biomedical engineering</strong> and <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>, where I focus on creating scalable AI systems that improve patient care and health outcomes.</p>

<p>Since 2021, I’ve honed my expertise in <strong>EEG (electroencephalography)</strong>, working with both software and hardware technologies. My primary focus is on <strong>algorithm development</strong>, particularly in advancing neurodiagnostic applications. I love to dive deep into complex problems and design solutions that can have a real-world impact on healthcare.</p>

<p>When I’m not working on AI solutions, I’m captivated by the world of <strong>computational neuroscience</strong>. It’s an area I’m always eager to explore more, and I thrive on learning and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in AI and neuroscience.</p>

<p>In addition to my technical work, I’m also a believer in collaboration. I’m always open to working with like-minded professionals and exploring new opportunities that can challenge me and help me grow. If you’re interested in collaborating or discussing ideas, don’t hesitate to reach out!</p>
